# Super Chicken Boy: Code Documentation

Welcome to the code documentation for Super Chicken Boy! This guide will provide an overview of the game's code structure, key components, and how they interact to create the game experience.

## Folder Structure:
- **assets**: Contains all the game assets such as sprites, sound effects, and music.
- **scripts**: Contains the game scripts written in the programming language of choice (e.g., Python, C#, JavaScript).
- **levels**: Stores level data in a format that can be easily loaded by the game.

## Key Components:
1. **Main Script:** 
   - Responsible for initializing the game, setting up the game loop, and managing scene transitions.
   - Handles input from the player and updates the game state accordingly.

2. **Player Controller:**
   - Manages the movement, jumping, and interactions of the player character (Chicken Boy).
   - Detects collisions with platforms, hazards, and collectibles.

3. **Level Manager:**
   - Loads level data from files stored in the 'levels' folder.
   - Instantiates and places game objects (platforms, hazards, enemies) based on the level data.

4. **Collision Detection:**
   - Checks for collisions between game objects (e.g., player, enemies, projectiles, obstacles).
   - Handles collision resolution and determines the outcome of collisions (e.g., player death, item collection).

5. **UI Manager:**
   - Displays relevant information to the player, such as the current score, remaining lives, and level progress.
   - Handles UI elements such as buttons, menus, and text prompts.

## Code Structure:
- **Main Loop:** 
  - Initializes the game engine and sets up the main loop to update and render the game.
  - Manages the flow of the game, including loading scenes, handling input, and updating game objects.

- **Game Objects:** 
  - Each game object (player, enemies, platforms, collectibles) is represented by a class or data structure.
  - Contains properties such as position, size, velocity, and behavior methods for movement and interaction.

- **Event Handling:** 
  - Listens for input events (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks) and triggers corresponding actions in the game.
  - Utilizes event listeners or input polling to detect player input.

## Dependencies:
- Specify any external libraries, frameworks, or tools used in the development of Super Chicken Boy.
- Include instructions for installing and configuring these dependencies if necessary.

## Conclusion:
Super Chicken Boy's codebase is organized and modular, allowing for easy maintenance and extension. By understanding the key components and structure of the code, developers can effectively modify, expand, or optimize the game to suit their needs. Happy coding, and may your adventures with Chicken Boy be egg-cellent!
